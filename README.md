# 🎒 Open Badge Showcase: Achievement System for Researchers and Communities

This project is a **Proof of Concept (PoC)** born from the need to bridge the gap between academic/scientific prestige and digital portability. 

Originally designed for the **Aura CIAN** and **El Pez Volador** ecosystems, this system allows researchers and professionals to display their milestones (such as INSAR Awards, Google Cloud, Adobe, or NASA Space Apps certifications) directly on their professional profiles using WordPress, ACF, and BuddyPress.

## 🌟 Open Science: Join the Initiative
This is an **Open Science** project. I am sharing this code because I believe institutional validation should be accessible, verifiable, and permanent—especially for researchers in **LMIC (Low and Middle Income Countries)** territories and **neurodivergent** communities.

**How can you participate?**
* **Are you a researcher?** Fork this repo and adapt it to your own portfolio or personal site.
* **Are you a developer?** Help us improve the automation between Open Badge platforms and community profiles.
* **Are you an institution?** Adopt this standard to empower your awardees with portable digital credentials.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **WordPress + BuddyPress**: Community core.
* **ACF (Advanced Custom Fields)**: Metadata storage for badges (images, titles, and links).
* **PHP Snippets**: Dynamic rendering on the frontend (User Profile).

## 🚀 Quick Setup
1. Create fields in ACF using the slug pattern `imagen_01`, `titulo_01`, etc.
2. Add the PHP snippet (included in this repo) to your `functions.php` or a Snippets plugin.
3. Start showcasing your achievements!
